# Villa Pennisi 2024: Python Primer and PINN Experiments

## Introduction

Welcome to this repository, which serves as a comprehensive resource for learning Python fundamentals and exploring basic applications in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This repository is structured to provide a gentle learning experience, starting with a Python primer for beginners and progressing to practical implementations of PINNs for solving the 1D wave equation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two key sections:

1. **Python Primer**:
   - **Basic Syntax and Structure**: An introduction to Python's syntax, including variables, data types, and basic operations. This section is perfect for beginners and serves as a foundation for understanding more complex code.
   - **Control Flow**: A detailed look at how to use conditional statements and loops in Python. Examples include `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, as well as `for` and `while` loops.
   - **Data Structures**: This section covers Python's fundamental data structures, including lists, tuples, and dictionaries, with examples of how to create, access, and modify them.
   - **Functions**: An exploration of defining and using functions in Python, including passing arguments, returning values, and using default parameters.
   - **Basic Libraries and Practical Examples**: An introduction to essential libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, along with practical examples related to scientific computing and data visualization.

2. **PINN to solve the 1D wave equation**:
   - **Training a PINN Model**: A detailed walkthrough of training a PINN to solve the 1D wave equation. This section includes data preparation, model definition, loss function formulation, and the training loop.
   - **Solution Comparison with Analytical Results**: This section focuses on comparing the PINN's predictions with the analytical solution of the 1D wave equation. It includes visualization and analysis of the model's performance.
   - **Enhanced Results with Larger Model**: An advanced chapter demonstrating improved results using a larger PINN model, highlighting the benefits of increased model complexity.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Getting Started**: Begin with the Python primer to familiarize yourself with basic programming concepts and Python syntax. This foundational knowledge will be crucial for understanding the more advanced topics covered later.
2. **Exploring PINNs**: Once comfortable with Python, dive into the PINN implementation. Follow the provided Jupyter notebooks for more in-depth desciption of the implementations of neural networks for solving differential equations.
3. **Hands-on Practice**: The repository encourages hands-on practice. Modify the scripts, experiment with different parameters, and try additional exercises to deepen your understanding.
