The focus of this analysis is to understand the capability of the PINN in capturing the dynamics of wave propagation with a reduced model architecture and to compare the predicted results with the analytical solution.\n","\n","#### Objectives\n","\n","1. **Loading Pre-Trained Weights**:\n","   - We will load the pre-trained weights from a smaller PINN model stored as checkpoints on Google Drive. This model has been previously trained on the 1D wave equation dataset, incorporating initial and boundary conditions.\n","\n","2. **Comparison with Analytical Solution**:\n","   - The analytical solution of the 1D wave equation provides an exact reference to evaluate the accuracy of the PINN's predictions. We will compare the model's outputs with the analytical solution at various time steps to assess its performance.\n","\n","3. **Visualization and Analysis**:\n","   - Visualizations will be used to compare the predicted waveforms and the analytical solution, highlighting any discrepancies or errors.
